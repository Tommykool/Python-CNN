# Face Recognition Application

## Abstract

A Python implementation of Retina + Arcface for detects faces and performs facial/ identity recognition. This application contains two main functions: registering faces and perform recognition on real-time video feed.

## Requirements
- [Install CUDA and CUDNN](https://medium.com/geekculture/install-cuda-and-cudnn-on-windows-linux-52d1501a8805) (use VPN if your ISP block Medium)
- Get source code and install python dependencies (using virtual environment is recommend)
```sh
git clone https://github.com/maybehieu/PytorchFaceRecognition.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- Database structure:
>
    database
    ├── Identity_A     # Name of this folder will be name of identity
    │   ├── img1.png   # Image contains ONLY ONE face
    │   ├── img2.jpg         
    │   └── ...              
    ├── Identity_B
    └── ...
>

## Training
- In development...

## Inference
- Acquire pretrained weights (provided by [pytorch-retinaface](https://github.com/biubug6/Pytorch_Retinaface), [arcface-torch](https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface/tree/master/recognition/arcface_torch)) and extract to ```weights``` folder: [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ipqfq24pj28ie5h/weights.rar?dl=0)

- Run the program
```sh
python main.py -m 0 -dp database
# -m: program mode - 0: register, 1:recognition
# -dp: database path - default: database
```
## TODO

- [ ] Enable inferencing on both live webcam and read from video
- [ ] Linux compatible version
- [ ] Choose and register from many faces which exists in one frame
- [ ] Optimize program work's flow 
- ...
